//I. Variables & Datatypes//



//How do we assign a value to a variable?
//var x = 2



//How do we change the value of a variable?
var x = 2; //X is global and value is 2.

function myFunction()
{
x = 7; //x is local variable and value is 7.
}

//How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?



//Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?

var x =  declares the value
var x = 8()  assigns the value
console.log(8);
  

//What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
It is a detailed, step-by-step description of what a computer must do, expressed in plain English
rather than in a programming language.


//What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
 It would depend what is being asked, what are they asking, what they looking for and what kind of end result needs to be achieved.



//A. Q + A//



//Create a variable called firstVariable.
//Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
var firstVariable = "Hello World";
//Change the value of this variable to some number.
firstVariable = "10 ";
//Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called secondVariable
var secondVariable = 
//Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
secondVariable = [my, name, is, "jean"];
//What is the value of firstVariable?

//Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes 
//the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
var yourName = ("jean");
var hello = ("hello, my name is ");
var sayHello = hello + yourName

//B. Strings//

//Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks so that all log statements print true in the console. Answers should be all be valid JS syntax and not weird things that don't make sense but happen to print true to the console.
// const a = 4;
//  const b = 53;
//  const c = 57;
//  const d = 16;
//  const e = 'Kevin';

  console.log(a _<_ b);
  console.log(c _>_ d);
  console.log('Name' _===_ 'Name');
  console.log(true _||_ false);
  console.log(false _&&_ false _&&_ false _&&_ false _&&_ false _&&_ false _=>_ true);
  console.log(false _===_ false)
  console.log(e _==_ 'Kevin');
  console.log(a _<_ b _>_ c);
  console.log(a _==_ a _<_ d);
  console.log(48 _>=_ '48');




//C. Booleans//




//Declare a variable animal. Set it to be either "cow" or something else.
//Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the it is equal to cow.
//Change your code so that if the variable animal is anything other than a cow, it will print "Hey! You're not a cow."
//Commit.

var animal = function ("cow"){
    if ("cow" = ""){
        return "Moooo";{
        }else{
          return "hey, your not a cow!";
    }
};



//D. The farm//




//Make a variable that will hold a person's age. Be semantic.

//Write code that will print out "Here are the keys", if the age is 16 years or older.

//If the age is younger than 16, a message should print "Sorry, you're too young."


var personsAge = funtion(age) {
    if (age < 16) {
        return "sorry, your too young.";
    } else {
        return "Here are the keys";
    }
};

// Driver's Ed//




//II. Loops//






//Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive.
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(+i);
}

//Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400.
for(let i = 10; i < 400; i++){
    console.log(+i);
}

//Write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 and going no higher than 4000.

for  (let i = 12; i < 4000; i +=3){
    console.log(i);
  }




//A. The basics//




for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++){
    if(i % 2===0)
    console.log('<--'+i);
}


//B. Get even//



//For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a number. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five.
for(let i = 1; 1 <=100){
  if(i % 5 === 0){
    console.log('high five');
  }
}
//I found a 5. High five!
for(let i = 1; 1 <=100){
  if(i % 10 === 0){
    console.log('high five');
  }
}
//I found a 10. High five!
for(let i = 1; 1 <=100){
  if(i % 3 === 0){
    console.log('high five');
  }
}
//Add to the code from above to print out "I found a number. Three is a crowd" if the number is a multiple of three.
for(let i = 1; 1 <=100){
  if(i % 5 === 0){
    console.log('high five');
  }
  for(i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    if(i % 3 === 0){
      console.log('Three is a crowd')
       }
       else if(i % 5 === 0){
         console.log('High five')
       }
       else if(i % 6 === 0){
         console.log('Six is a crowd')
       }
         else if(i % 9 === 0){
           console.log('Nine is a crowd')
       }
         else if(i % 10 === 0){
           console.log('high five');
         }
         else {
           console.log("x")
         }
    }




//C. Give me Five// I know my wording is different but it was easier to check the console.log




//Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 10 to a variable called bank_account.

//If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

//Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. If a previous question you've done has 
//helpful bits of code in it that partially solves this problem, look back at them.

//You just solved Project Euler problem 1!

//Are you having dejÃ  vu? This just in! From the "Read the entire problem before you start" dept: 
//This problem was on a previous assignment. You may skip it if you've already done it, just include a comment saying that 
//you've already done it. If you've now done the problem twice, perhaps next time you'll read the whole problem before starting it.

  if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
    sum += i;
      }
    }
  



//E. Multiples of 3 and 5//






//II. Arrays & Control flow//




//What are the things in an array called?

It means is that you can store other variables and objects inside an array and can retrieve them from the array by referring to their 
position number in the array. Each variable or object in an array is called an element.



//Do Arrays guarantee those things will be in order?

No,there is no guarantee about which element will be found.




//What real-life thing could you model with an array?

Organize daily, weekly, monthly Activities as well as product listings.



//A. Talk about it://




//How do you access the 1st element in the array?

for(let i = 1; i < arryay.length; i++)
//or
for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) 

Change the value of "Hello" to "World".

const " " = [ 'hello', 'bye']
" " [0] = "world"
 


//Check the value of the array to make sure it updated the array. How? Why, yes! console.log();

for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) { 
  someFunction(myArray[i]); 
  } 


//C. Accessing elements//




//Given the following array const ourClass = ["Salty", "Zoom", "Sardine", "Slack", "Github"]
//What would you write to access the 3rd element of the array?

ourClass = ourClass[1] + 1

//Change the value of "Github" to "Octocat"

ourClass.pop()
ourClass.push ("Octocat")

//Add a new element, "Cloud City" to the array.

ourClass.splice(1, 5, "Cloud City")






//D. Change values//




//Given the following array: const myArray = [5, 10, 500, 20]

const myArray = [5, 10, 500, 20]

//Add the string "Egon" to the end of the array. Add another string of your choice to the end of the array.

myArray.push("Egon")

//Remove the 5 from the beginning of the array.

const firstElement = myArray.shift();


//Add the string "Bob Marley" to the beginning of the array.

myArray.splice(1, 0, "Bob Marley")

//Remove the string of your choise from the end of the array.

myArray.pop()

//Reverse this array using Array.prototype.reverse(). Did you mutate the array? What does mutate mean? 
//Did the .reverse() method return anything?

const reversed = myArray.reversed



//E. Mix It Up//





//Create a variable that contains an integer.

const num = (100)


//Write an if ... else statement that:

if(i =0; i => 100; i++){
     if num => 100 (console.log "little number"){
     }else{
         console.log("big number")
    }
};
//console.log()s "little number" if the number is entered is less than 100

//console.log()s big number if the number is greater than or equal to 100.




//F. Biggie Smalls//



if(i = 0; i => 10; i++){
    else if(num < 10){
      console.log("little number"){
      }else if(num == 10){
          console.log("big number"){
      }else{
        console.log(monkey)
      }
    }
};
//Write an if ... else if ... else statement:

//console.log() little number if the number entered is less than 5.

//If the number entered is more than 10, log big number.

//Otherwise, log "monkey". 


//G. Monkey in the Middle//





Below, we've given you examples of Kristyn and Thom's closets modeled as data in JavaScript.

const kristynsCloset = [

  ]
];


//What's Kristyn wearing today? Using bracket notation to access items in kristynsCloset,

const krystynsCloset = ["left shoe", "cowboy boots", "right shoe", "GA hoodie", "green pants", "yellow nit hat", "marshmallow peeps"]


//log the sentence "Kristyn is rocking that " + the third item in Kristyn's closet + " today!" to the console.

console.log("Krystyn will be wearing " krystynsCloset [3])



//Kristyn just bought some sweet shades! Add "raybans" to her closet after "yellow knit hat".

krystynsCloset.splice(5, 1 "raybans")

//Kristyn spilled coffee on her hat... modify this item to read "stained knit hat" instead of yellow.

krystynsCloset.splice(1, 5);

//Put together an outfit for Thom! Using bracket notation, access the first element in Thom's shirts array.

console.log("Thom is wearing" + thomsCloset([1].slice (2, 3) + ',' thomCloset[0].slice(3, 4) + ',' thomsCloset[2].slice(1, 1)) 

//In the same way, access one item from Thom's pants array.

console.log(thomsCloset[2, 1])

//Access one item from Thom's accessories array.

console.log(thomsCloset[3, 2])

//Log a sentence about what Thom's wearing. Example: "Thom is looking fierce in a grey button-up, jeans and wool scarf!"

console.log("Thom is looking fierce in a gray button-up, jeans and wool scarf!")

//Get more specific about what kind of PJs Thom's wearing this winter. Modify the name of his PJ pants to Footie Pajamas.

const printGreeting = function (name)


var sayHello = function () { 
  var name = "Slimer!"; 
  console.log("Hello there, " + name); 
   };

//Do you think you could write a function called printGreeting with a parameter name that returns a 
//greeting with the argument interpolated into the greeting?

//Like so?

//console.log(printGreeting("Slimer"));
//=> Hello there, Slimer!

//You think you could? I think so too. Feel free to skip this problem, because you've already done it. 
//If you've done the problem twice, read entire problems carefully before doing them from now on.

Write a function getTwoLengths that accepts two parameters (strings). The function should return an array of numbers where 
each number is the length of the corresponding string.

console.log(getTwoLengths("Hank", "Hippopopalous"));
=> [4, 13]

if()

Define a function maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. If all numbers are the same, it doesn't matter which one is returned. If the two largest numbers are the same, one of them should be returned.

console.log(maxOfThree(6, 9, 1));
=> 9



//G. maxOfThree//





Write a function printLongestWord that accepts a single argument, an array of strings. The method should return the longest word in the array. In case of a tie, the method should return the word that appears first in the array.
