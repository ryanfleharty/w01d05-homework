// A. Q + A

// How do we assign a value to a variable?
    let variable = "value"; //CANNONT USE CONST....ONLY VAR OR LET

// How do we change the value of a variable?
    variable = "newValue";
// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
    let newVariable = variable;
// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
    var something; //declare
    var something = 12; //define
    something = variable; //assign NOW = newValue via variable

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
    
    /*Pseudocoding is a detailed, yet readable description of what a computer program 
    or algorithm os trying to solve. No syntax is used and it is meant for descriping the 
    flow of the program while not getting into detail. It is necesary when planning out a complex problem`*/

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
    /*According to prior lab on objects, "Timewise, programming is 
        75-90% planning, and 10-25% actually typing code.".*/

// Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string.

// Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.

// ## II. Loops
// Remember: **USE `let` when you initialize your for loops!**
// This is GOOD: `for(`**`let i = 0;`**` i < 100; i++)`
// This is NO GOOD: `for(i = 0; i < 100; i++)`

// ### A. The basics

// 1. Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive.
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i ++) {
        console.log(i);
    };

// 2. Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400.
    for (let i = 10; i <= 400; i ++) {
        console.log(i);
    };

// 3. Write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 and going no higher than 4000.
    for (let i = 12; i < 4000; i+= 3) {     //MUST add "= after "+ if incrementing by more than 1
        console.log(i);
    };

// :red_circle: Commit. //DONE

// ### B. Get even

// 1. Print out the even numbers that are within the range of 1 - 100.
    for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i += 2) {
        console.log(i);
    };

// 2. Adjust your code to add a message next to even numbers only that says: "<-- is an even number".
    for (let i = 2; i <= 100; i += 2) {
        console.log(`${i} is the even number`);
    };

// :red_circle: Commit. //DONE


// ### C. Give me Five
// 1. For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a `number`. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five.

    for (let i = 5; i <= 100; i ++) {
        if (i % 5 === 0){
            console.log(`I found a ${i}. High Five!`);
        }};

// 2. Add to the code from above to print out "I found a `number`. Three is a crowd" if the number is a multiple of three.
    for (let i = 3; i <= 100; i ++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0){
            console.log(`I found a ${i}. Three is a crowd`);

// ### D. Savings account
// 1. Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 10 to a variable called `bank_account`.
    let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
    var bankAccount = 0;                        //DECLARE GLOBALLY
    let numberSum = () => {

            bankAccount = bankAccount += numbers[i];   //+= add to variable bankAccount which starts at zero
        };
        console.log(bankAccount);  //Will display info in console
    };
    numberSum();
   
// >Check your work! Your bank_account should have $55 in it.

// 2. You got a bonus! Your pay is now doubled each week. Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 100 multiplied by 2.

    var bankAccount2 = 0;                        
    let numberSum2 = () => {

        };
        console.log(bankAccount3);  
    };
    numberSum2();


// >Check your work! Your banck_account should have $10,100 in it.

// ### E. Multiples of 3 and 5

// If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

// Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.  If a previous question you've done has helpful bits of code in it that partially solves this problem, look back at them.

// You just solved [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) problem 1!  

// Are you having dejÃ  vu? This just in! From the "Read the entire problem before you start" dept: This problem was on a previous assignment.  You may skip it **if you've already done it**, just include a comment saying that you've already done it. If you've now done the problem twice, perhaps next time you'll read the whole problem before starting it.
