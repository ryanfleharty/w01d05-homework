// A. Q + A

// How do we assign a value to a variable?
    let variable = "value"; //CANNONT USE CONST....ONLY VAR OR LET

// How do we change the value of a variable?
    variable = "newValue";
// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
    let newVariable = variable;
// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
    var something; //declare
    var something = 12; //define
    something = variable; //assign NOW = newValue via variable

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
    
    /*Pseudocoding is a detailed, yet readable description of what a computer program 
    or algorithm os trying to solve. No syntax is used and it is meant for descriping the 
    flow of the program while not getting into detail. It is necesary when planning out a complex problem`*/

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
    /*According to prior lab on objects, "Timewise, programming is 
        75-90% planning, and 10-25% actually typing code.".*/

// B. Strings

// Create a variable called firstVariable.
    let firstVariable;
// Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
    firstVariable = "Hello World";
// Change the value of this variable to some number.
    firstVariable = 37;
// Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called secondVariable
    let secondVariable = firstVariable;
// Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
    secondVariable = "String";
// What is the value of firstVariable?
    //  37
// Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. 
    let yourName = "Shadi";
// Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
    let expression = "Hello, my name is " + yourName + "!";
// ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean

// Write code that will print out "Here are the keys", if the age is 16 years or older.
